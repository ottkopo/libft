Libft was the first project after the Piscine (basically the entrance exam to Hive). It was an entry level where you were tasked with recreating many functions that we could then use for later projects. It contains very basic funtions such as strjoin, strcat, lstnew, putstr, but there are also a few functions that proved to be quite a challenge at that point (3 years ago when I had just started coding) in my studies, such as atoi, itoa and strsplit.


Source code for all my functions can be found in this repository, and still to this day I use this library in my studies since using the precoded lib functions is forbidden at Hive.
